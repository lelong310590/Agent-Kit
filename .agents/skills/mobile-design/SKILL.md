name: mobile-design
description: Mobile-first design thinking and decision-making for iOS and Android apps. Touch interaction, performance patterns, platform conventions. Teaches principles, not fixed values. Use when building React Native, Flutter, or native mobile apps.
when_to_use: "When designing mobile app interfaces for iOS/Android, React Native, or Flutter. Touch interaction and platform conventions. NOT for web apps."
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Bash

# Mobile Design System

> **Philosophy:** Touch-first. Battery-conscious. Platform-respectful. Offline-capable.
> **Core Principle:** Mobile is NOT a small desktop. THINK mobile constraints, ASK platform choice.

## 🔧 Runtime Scripts

**Execute these for validation (don't read, just run):**

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/mobile_audit.py` | Mobile UX & Touch Audit | `python scripts/mobile_audit.py <project_path>` |

## 🔴 MANDATORY: Read Reference Files Before Working!

**⛔ DO NOT start development until you read the relevant files:**

### Universal (Always Read)

| File | Content | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **[mobile-design-thinking.md](mobile-design-thinking.md)** | **⚠️ ANTI-MEMORIZATION: Forces thinking, prevents AI defaults** | **⬜ CRITICAL FIRST** |
| **[touch-psychology.md](touch-psychology.md)** | **Fitts' Law, gestures, haptics, thumb zone** | **⬜ CRITICAL** |
| **[mobile-performance.md](mobile-performance.md)** | **RN/Flutter performance, 60fps, memory** | **⬜ CRITICAL** |
| **[mobile-backend.md](mobile-backend.md)** | **Push notifications, offline sync, mobile API** | **⬜ CRITICAL** |
| **[mobile-testing.md](mobile-testing.md)** | **Testing pyramid, E2E, platform-specific** | **⬜ CRITICAL** |
| **[mobile-debugging.md](mobile-debugging.md)** | **Native vs JS debugging, RN DevTools, Logcat** | **⬜ CRITICAL** |
| [mobile-navigation.md](mobile-navigation.md) | Tab/Stack/Drawer, deep linking | ⬜ Read |
| [mobile-typography.md](mobile-typography.md) | System fonts, Dynamic Type, a11y | ⬜ Read |
| [mobile-color-system.md](mobile-color-system.md) | OLED, dark mode, battery-aware | ⬜ Read |
| [decision-trees.md](decision-trees.md) | Framework/state/storage selection | ⬜ Read |

> 🧠 **mobile-design-thinking.md is PRIORITY!** This file ensures AI thinks instead of using memorized patterns.

### Platform-Specific (Read Based on Target)

| Platform | File | Content | When to Read |
|----------|------|---------|--------------|
| **iOS** | [platform-ios.md](platform-ios.md) | Human Interface Guidelines, SF Pro, SwiftUI patterns | Building for iPhone/iPad |
| **Android** | [platform-android.md](platform-android.md) | Material Design 3, Roboto, Compose patterns | Building for Android |
| **Cross-Platform** | Both above | Platform divergence points | React Native / Flutter |

> 🔴 **If building for iOS → Read platform-ios.md FIRST!**
> 🔴 **If building for Android → Read platform-android.md FIRST!**
> 🔴 **If cross-platform → Read BOTH and apply conditional platform logic!**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: ASK BEFORE ASSUMING (MANDATORY)

> **STOP! If the user's request is open-ended, DO NOT default to your favorites.**

### You MUST Ask If Not Specified:

| Aspect | Ask | Why |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Platform** | "iOS, Android, or both?" | Affects EVERY design decision |
| **Framework** | "React Native, Flutter, or native?" | Determines patterns and tools |
| **Navigation** | "Tab bar, drawer, or stack-based?" | Core UX decision |
| **State** | "What state management? (Zustand/Redux/Riverpod/BLoC?)" | Architecture foundation |
| **Offline** | "Does this need to work offline?" | Affects data strategy |
| **Target devices** | "Phone only, or tablet support?" | Layout complexity |

### ⛔ AI MOBILE ANTI-PATTERNS (BANNED LIST)

> 🚫 **These are AI default tendencies that MUST be avoided!**

#### Performance Sins

| ❌ NEVER DO | Why It's Wrong | ✅ ALWAYS DO |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **ScrollView for long lists** | Renders ALL items, memory explodes | Use `FlatList` / `FlashList` / `ListView.builder` |
| **Inline renderItem function** | New function every render, all items re-render | `useCallback` + `React.memo` |
| **Missing keyExtractor** | Index-based keys cause bugs on reorder | Unique, stable ID from data |
| **Skip getItemLayout** | Async layout = janky scroll | Provide when items have fixed height |
| **setState() everywhere** | Unnecessary widget rebuilds | Targeted state, `const` constructors |
| **Native driver: false** | Animations blocked by JS thread | `useNativeDriver: true` always |
| **console.log in production** | Blocks JS thread severely | Remove before release build |
| **Skip React.memo/const** | Every item re-renders on any change | Memoize list items ALWAYS |

#### Touch/UX Sins

| ❌ NEVER DO | Why It's Wrong | ✅ ALWAYS DO |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Touch target < 44px** | Impossible to tap accurately, frustrating | Minimum 44pt (iOS) / 48dp (Android) |
| **Spacing < 8px between targets** | Accidental taps on neighbors | Minimum 8-12px gap |
| **Gesture-only interactions** | Motor impaired users excluded | Always provide button alternative |
| **No loading state** | User thinks app crashed | ALWAYS show loading feedback |
| **No error state** | User stuck, no recovery path | Show error with retry option |
| **No offline handling** | Crash/block when network lost | Graceful degradation, cached data |
| **Ignore platform conventions** | Users confused, muscle memory broken | iOS feels iOS, Android feels Android |

#### Security Sins

| ❌ NEVER DO | Why It's Wrong | ✅ ALWAYS DO |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Token in AsyncStorage** | Easily accessible, stolen on rooted device | `SecureStore` / `Keychain` / `EncryptedSharedPreferences` |
| **Hardcode API keys** | Reverse engineered from APK/IPA | Environment variables, secure storage, or proxy backend |
| **No SSL Pinning** | Vulnerable to MITM attacks | Implement SSL pinning for sensitive APIs |
| **Export plain debug logs** | Exposes internals | Clean logs in release configurations |
