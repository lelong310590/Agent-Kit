# Brand register

When design IS the product: brand sites, landing pages, marketing surfaces, campaign pages, portfolios, long-form content, about pages. The deliverable is the design itself; a visitor's impression is the thing being made.

The register spans every genre. A tech brand (Stripe, Linear, Vercel). A luxury brand (a hotel, a fashion house). A consumer product (a restaurant, a travel site, a CPG packaging page). A creative studio, an agency portfolio, a band's album page. They all share the stance (*communicate, not transact*) and diverge wildly in aesthetic. Don't collapse them into a single look.

## The brand slop test

If someone could look at this and say "AI made that" without hesitation, it's failed. The bar is distinctiveness; a visitor should ask "how was this made?", not "which AI made this?"

Brand isn't a neutral register. AI-generated landing pages have flooded the internet, and average is no longer findable. Restraint without intent now reads as mediocre, not refined. Brand surfaces need a POV, a specific audience, a willingness to risk strangeness. Go big or go home.

**The second slop test: aesthetic lane.** Before committing to moves, name the reference. A Klim-style specimen page is one lane; Stripe-minimal is another; Liquid-Death-acid-maximalism is another. Don't drift into editorial-magazine aesthetics on a brief that isn't editorial. A hiking brand with Cormorant italic drop caps has the wrong register within the register.

Then the inverse test: in one sentence, describe what you're about to build the way a competitor would describe theirs. If that sentence fits the modal landing page in the category, restart.

## Typography

### Font selection procedure

Every project. Never skip.

1. Read the brief. Write three concrete brand-voice words. Not "modern" or "elegant," but "warm and mechanical and opinionated" or "calm and clinical and careful." Physical-object words.
2. List the three fonts you'd reach for by reflex. If any appear in the reflex-reject list below, reject them; they are training-data defaults and they create monoculture.
3. Browse a real catalog (Google Fonts, Pangram Pangram, Future Fonts, Adobe Fonts, ABC Dinamo, Klim, Velvetyne) with the three words in mind. Find the font for the brand as a *physical object*: a museum caption, a 1970s terminal manual, a fabric label, a cheap-newsprint children's book, a concert poster, a receipt from a mid-century diner. Reject the first thing that "looks designy."
4. Cross-check. "Elegant" is not necessarily serif. "Technical" is not necessarily sans. "Warm" is not Fraunces. If the final pick lines up with the original reflex, start over.

### Reflex-reject list

Training-data defaults. Ban list. Look further:

Fraunces · Newsreader · Lora · Crimson · Crimson Pro · Crimson Text · Playfair Display · Cormorant · Cormorant Garamond · Syne · IBM Plex Mono · IBM Plex Sans · IBM Plex Serif · Space Mono · Space Grotesk · Inter · DM Sans · DM Serif Display · DM Serif Text · Outfit · Plus Jakarta Sans · Instrument Sans · Instrument Serif

### Reflex-reject aesthetic lanes

Parallel to the font list. Currently saturated aesthetic families that have flooded brand surfaces. If a brief lands in one of these lanes without a register reason that *requires* it (a literal magazine, a literal terminal, a literal industrial signage system), it's the second-order training reflex: the trap one tier deeper than picking a Fraunces font. Look further.

- **Editorial-typographic.** Display serif (often italic) + small mono labels + ruled separators + monochromatic restraint. Klim-influenced, magazine-cover affectation. By 2026, every Stripe-adjacent and Notion-adjacent brand has landed here. The fingerprint: three rule-separated columns, an italic Fraunces / Recoleta / Newsreader headline, lowercase track-spaced metadata, no imagery.

(More entries land here on the same cadence the font list updates. Brutalist-utility and acid-maximalism may join when they saturate. Removing entries when they fall back below saturation is also fine.)

The reflex-reject lists apply to **new design choices**. When the existing brand has already committed to a font or a lane as part of its identity, identity-preservation wins; variants on an existing surface don't second-guess what's already shipping. The reflex-reject lists are for greenfield decisions and for departure-mode variants in [live.md](live.md).

### Pairing and voice

Distinctive + refined is the goal. The specific shape depends on the brand, not on the brand's category. A category ("restaurant", "dev tool", "magazine", "fintech") is not a recipe; treating it as one is the first-order reflex SKILL.md warns against.

Two families minimum is the rule *only* when the voice needs it. A single well-chosen family with committed weight/size contrast is stronger than a timid display+body pair.

### Scale

Modular scale, fluid `clamp()` for headings, ≥1.25 ratio between steps. Flat scales (1.1× apart) read as uncommitted.

Lightweight display needs tight letter-spacing. Heavy display needs tight letter-spacing and substantial size contrast.
