# Systematic Debugging

> Source: obra/superpowers

## Overview
This skill provides a structured approach to debugging that prevents random guessing and ensures problems are properly understood before solving.

## 4-Phase Debugging Process

### Phase 1: Reproduce
Before fixing, reliably reproduce the issue.

```markdown
## Reproduction Steps
1. [Exact step to reproduce]
2. [Next step]
3. [Expected vs actual result]

## Reproduction Rate
- [ ] Always (100%)
- [ ] Often (50-90%)
- [ ] Sometimes (10-50%)
- [ ] Rare (<10%)
```

### Phase 2: Isolate
Narrow down the source.

```markdown
## Isolation Questions
- When did this start happening?
- What changed recently?
- Does it happen in all environments?
- Can we reproduce with minimal code?
- What's the smallest change that triggers it?
```

### Phase 3: Understand
Find the root cause, not just symptoms.

```markdown
## Root Cause Analysis
### The 5 Whys
```
